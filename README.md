# DocuChat - Advanced Intelligent Document Chat System

DocuChat is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows you to have intelligent conversations with your documents. Upload PDFs, Word documents, resumes, and more, then ask questions and get AI-powered answers based on your content.

## Why RAG? Why This Architecture?

### The Problem with Traditional Chatbots

Traditional chatbots either:
- Hallucinate (make up answers)
- Have limited knowledge (only what they were trained on)
- Can't access your specific documents
- Lack contextual understanding of document relationships

### Our Enhanced Solution: Advanced RAG Architecture

We implemented an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that:
- Processes your documents into searchable chunks with intelligent segmentation
- Creates interactive knowledge graphs showing document relationships
- Generates automated document summaries
- Provides document preview thumbnails
- Manages multiple chat sessions with history
- Retrieves relevant content using semantic search with context awareness
- Generates accurate answers based on your specific content

## Enhanced Technical Architecture

```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Get your free Groq API key from [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com)

### Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Supported File Types

| Format | Support Level | Best For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| PDF | Excellent | Reports, resumes, research papers |
| DOCX | Excellent | Word documents, formatted content |
| TXT | Excellent | Simple text, code, notes |
| XLSX | Good | Spreadsheets, data tables |
| CSV | Good | Structured data, exports |

## How It Works

### 1. Enhanced Document Processing Pipeline

```python
# Step 1: Extract text with format preservation
text = extract_text_from_file(uploaded_file)

# Step 2: Generate document preview and summary
preview = create_file_preview(uploaded_file)
summary = generate_document_summary(text, filename)

# Step 3: Intelligent chunking (not just naive splitting)
chunks = split_text_into_chunks(text)  # Respects sections, paragraphs, sentences

# Step 4: Entity extraction for knowledge graph
entities = extract_entities(text)

# Step 5: Create embeddings and store
collection.add(documents=chunks, embeddings=embeddings)
```

### 2. Advanced Retrieval System with Knowledge Integration

Our enhanced system doesn't just do simple similarity search - it:
- Detects resume content and handles projects/experience specially
- Combines multiple queries to ensure complete results
- Prioritizes context preservation with metadata tracking
- Builds knowledge graphs showing document relationships
- Tracks entity connections across queries and documents

### 3. Intelligent Response Generation with Context Awareness

```python
# Custom prompts for different query types
if "project" in query.lower():
    prompt = resume_analysis_prompt
elif research_mode:
    prompt = deep_research_prompt
    update_knowledge_graph_with_query(query, response)  # Enhance knowledge graph
else:
    prompt = standard_chat_prompt

# Generate response with context awareness
response = generate_groq_response(query, context, research_mode)
```

### 4. Knowledge Graph Construction

```python
# Entity extraction and graph building
def create_knowledge_graph(chunks):
    for chunk in chunks:
        entities = extract_entities(chunk["text"])
        # Connect documents to entities
        # Build relationship network
        # Visualize connections
```
